## Overview so far
- On day one, we talked basics of data viz
- Day two was interactivity (in d3)
- Today we're talking scraping, text, and timelines

## Interactivity in R
- Shiny
- manipulate
- Shiny gadgets

## Getting data from the web
- Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- Scraping

We'll go through some of Scott, Karthik, and Garrett's useR tutorial. I'll flip through the API stuff, and we'll focus on scraping. 

## Some text

(I got the URL right this time-- notice it starts with `raw`.)

```{r}
library(RCurl)
htmlData <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/walkerkq/musiclyrics/master/billboard_lyrics_1964-2015.csv")
atus <- read.csv(text = htmlData)
```
